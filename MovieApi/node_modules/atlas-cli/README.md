# atlas-cli

Command line tool for [Atlas](https://www.beautifulatlas.com/) to import
your existing documentation.

## Installation

You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `npm` to install `atlas-cli`:

```shell
npm install atlas-cli -g
```

## Usage

Before you can start, you'll need to login with your Atlas account:

```shell
atlas login
```

This will open Atlas in a web browser and provide you with a secret token
which you'll need for login.


### Import local gitbook

```shell
atlas import /path/to/gitbook --gitbook
```

You can leave path empty if you're in the root directory of your gitbook, and `book.json`:

```shell
atlas import --gitbook
```
